<Chater 2-1. Number System>

[Definition of Number System]
-Classification of numbers based on their form

[Properties of Number System]
1. Addition and Multiplication must be 'well-defined'2. The set of elements must be infinite
3. Commutative, Associative, and Distributive laws must hold for addition and multiplication

[Natural Numbers]
Symbol: N
-Positive integers

[Integers]
Consist of positive integers, negative integers, and 0

[Rational Numbers]
Symbol: Q
-The set of numebers that can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p, q are integers and q != 0-Their decimal representation is either finite or infinitelt repeating with a fixed pattern

[Irrational Numbers]
-The set of real numbers that are not rational
-Their decimal representation is infinite and non-repeating

[Real Numbers]
Symbol: R
-The set consisting of rational and irrational numbers
-A real number is a number that, when squared, gives a non-negative result

[Complex Numbers]
-Numbers composed of real and imaginary parts
-Expressed as 'z = a + bi' where i^2 = -1
